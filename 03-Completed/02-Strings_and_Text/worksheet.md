# 📝 Worksheet: 03 - Strings and Text

Use this worksheet to reinforce your understanding of strings — creating them, slicing them, cleaning them up, and formatting them. Each section ends with an **🤖 Explain It** prompt — write your explanation in your own words, then (optionally) paste it into an AI tutor and ask it to point out anything you got wrong or left out.

## 🧠 Section 1: String Basics

1. Why doesn't Python care whether you use `'...'` or `"..."`?  
   `Answer:` It understands both as strings and accepts both so it is easier to use one within the string to the user preference

2. What's the output of this code?

```python
word = 'science'
print(word[0:3])
```

   `Answer:` sci

3. Rewrite this string so it could be written with single quotes on the outside instead of double:

```python
message = "She said \"don't stop\""
```

   `Answer:` message = 'She said "don't stop"'

### ✏️ Task: Slicing Practice

```python
# Given: course = "Programming for Data Science"
# Print just the word "Data" using slicing.
# Print the string reversed.
print(course[16:20])
print(course[::-1])

### ✏️ Task: Multi-Line String

```python
# Write a triple-quoted string containing a 3-line "About Me" bio.
# Print it.
me = '''I
am 
a fella'''
print(me)
```

### 🤖 Explain It

In your own words: why are strings immutable, and what do you actually have to do if you want a "modified" version of a string?

## 🔁 Section 2: String Methods

4. What's the difference between `.strip()` and `.replace(' ', '')`?  
   `Answer:` strip removes blank space at the beginning and end and the replace versions replaces all spaces throught the string

5. What will this print?

```python
name = "  ADA lovelace  "
print(name.strip().title())
```

   `Answer:` "Ada Lovelace"

6. If `words = "red,green,blue".split(',')`, what is `words`, and what type is it?  
   `Answer:` ['red', 'green', 'blue']

---

### ✏️ Task: Clean and Validate

```python
# Given: raw_input = "  YES  "
# Clean it up (strip + lowercase) and check if it equals "yes".
# Print True or False.
print(raw_input.strip().lower() == "yes"):

### ✏️ Task: Build a Sentence

```python
# Given: words = ['data', 'science', 'is', 'fun']
# Use .join() to turn this into the sentence "data science is fun".
# Then use .replace() to change "fun" to "powerful" in the result.
sentence = "".join(words)
print(sentence.replace("fun", "powerful"))
```

### 🤖 Explain It

In your own words: what's the difference between a method like `.upper()` that returns a new string, versus a list method like `.append()` that changes the list in place? Why do strings only work the first way?
Strings are immutable after being created and cannot be changed with creating a new string and allocating new memory, whereas lists are mutable and are built to have additions without creating a whole new list.

## 🎯 Section 3: Formatted Strings

7. What does the format spec `:.2f` do?  
   `Answer:` It ensures a number is printed with 2 decima places 

8. What will this print?

```python
item = "eraser"
qty = 5
print(f"You bought {qty} {item}(s)")
```

   `Answer:` "5 eraser(s)"

9. Why might you use an f-string instead of `+` to build a string out of variables?  
   `Answer:` Python automatically adds a space when concatening  with + so if you wanted there not to be space between a varible and a string you would use the f string fromat

---

### ✏️ Task: Formatted Receipt

```python
# Given: item = "Backpack", price = 45.999, qty = 2
# Print a line like: "2x Backpack @ $46.00 = $92.00"
# (Notice price needs rounding — that's what :.2f is for.)
```
print(f"{qty}x {item} @ ${price:.2f} = ${price * qty:.2f}")
### ✏️ Task: Aligned Table

```python
# Given: names = ["Ana", "Bartholomew", "Cy"]
# Print each name right-aligned in a 15-character field, one per line,
# so they all line up on the right edge.
print(name[0]:>15)
print(name[1]:>15)
print(name[2]:>15)
```

### 🤖 Explain It

In your own words: what's the practical difference between `f'{price}'` and `f'{price:.2f}'` when `price = 19.999999`? When would the difference actually matter in real code?
The first one, wihtout :.2f, will print all the decimals, and the second will round to two decimal places and print the result. The difference occurs when the float has more than two decimal places or when rounding it would result in a different number, like here where 19.999999 will be printed as 20.00

## 🚀 Section 4: Going Further (Optional)

These pair with the "🔥 Challenge" sections in the notebooks — skip if you haven't gotten there yet.

### ✏️ Task: Raw String

```python
# Write the Windows path C:\Users\you\Desktop\notes.txt as a raw string.
# Print it, and explain in a comment why the plain (non-raw) version would be risky.
```

### ✏️ Task: Debug Format Spec

```python
# Given: width = 10, height = 4
# Use the f'{expr=}' debug spec to print both "width" and "width * height"
# with their values, without writing separate print() calls for each.
```
